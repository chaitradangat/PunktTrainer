# PunktTrainer
Small Script to train the Punkt Sentence Tokenizer..
This step is very important while making use of the tokenizer.
A sample text file(preferably UTF-8) is provided as input,a model is created via unsupervised machine learning.
The model is saved as a .pickle file which can be then used to tokenize sentences for the concerned language.
